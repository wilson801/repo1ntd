                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Under  circumstances  such  as  the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of expert guidance is critical: in the paucity-of- data scenario, expert guidance can help create a ‘‘best guess’’ at recommended practices by using a combination of experience with similar diseases, known and  putative  biological  mechanisms, limited clinical data, and expertise in crit- ically  interpreting  imperfect  scientific Cell Reports Medicine 2 , 100375, August 17, 2021 ª 2021 The Author(s). Digital health platforms and EBM Digital  health  reference  applications, defined here as websites and mobile ap- plications designed to look up medical in- formation, have several advantages for clinicians:  point-of care  access from different kinds of devices, capacity for more frequent updating than textbooks, and non-linear presentation of information that permits cross-linking, decision sup- port tools, and interactive graphics. 9 There are three main types of guideline- forming organizations: (1) governmental and intergovernmental, such as national ministries of health and the World Health Organization (WHO); (2) societal, released by professional societies such as the In- fectious  Disease  Society  of  America (IDSA); and (3) institutional, produced by individual health care institutions. Traditional guideline development The  National Academies  of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) es- tablished eight standards for guideline development, which include transpar- ency,  managing  conflict  of  interest, establishing evidence foundations, and updating  ( www.nationalacademies.org/ our-work/standards-for-developing- trustworthy-clinical-practice-guidelines ). Here,  we  describe COVIDProtocols.org , a model of open- access and continuously updated guide- lines that was built using a CWA and has been  used  over  2  million  times  by 500,000 users in 196 countries. We discuss  the  challenges  of  emerging COVID data and misinformation, the limits of existing guidance structures, and the potential for digital health to solve some of these issues. 15 With  permission,  our  protocols  were incorporated and adapted into multiple hospital  and  governmental  protocols around the world (for example Armenia and Malawi). At the beginning of the pandemic, frontline healthcare workers faced an influx of pa- tients with limited and often poor-quality (case series, pre-print, and social media) information about diagnosis, treatment, and  infection  control  practices  for COVID-19. because  in-text literature  reviews  became  highly  un- wieldy, we developed a literature review database using the commercial collabo- ration platform Airtable.com that is linked in-text and allows users to pull sum- maries, evidence grading, and the original article by topic tag. Our experi- ence appears to depart from that of prior published wiki-based clinical guideline development in several ways: (1) we used Google Docs instead of wikis as the CMS to facilitate the learning curve for editors, (2) we used a professional development firm to design software that focused on end-user experience, and (3) we explicitly limited input to a small number of credible institutions. The US National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH) released COVID-19 clinical guidance on April 21, 2020, 3 months after the CDC declared coronavirus a public health emergency and almost 6 weeks after the WHO declared it a pandemic. The site received 1.38 million page views from over 417,000 users by August 2020, the majority of which occurred in the first month before the NIH and other guidance  organizations  released  their content. It is also clear that an enormous investment of dedicated time and effort is required to set up, manage, and  maintain  the  reviewing  system. Our initial guidelines focused on ter- tiary care, but in November 2020, the BWH team partnered with UCSF Open Critical Care and with Partners In Health as part of a United States Agency for Inter- national  Development  (USAID)-funded initiative to produce content relevant to both tertiary care and resource-variable settings. For  example,  early  in  the pandemic, The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) released initial guide- lines based on previous experience with sepsis and influenza. Notably, this process is volunteer driven and very labor intensive and would have been un- sustainable had it not been for the enthu- siasm of contributors and, 7 months after the project began, extramural grant fund- ing to cover the costs of coordination. E.Y.K. has received  unrelated  research  funding from Bayer, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Associa- tion, the American Lung Association, and the American Thoracic Society. , Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA 2 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA 3 Partners In Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA 4 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02115, USA 5 Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA 6 Center for Health Equity in Surgery and Anesthesia, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA 7 Lead contact *Correspondence Framework for Manag- ing the COVID-19 Infodemic: Methods and Re- sults  of  an  Online,  Crowdsourced  WHO Technical Consultation. The familiarity of the Google Docs interface for authors and the use of Google Docs as a CMS reduces delays in editing and publishing the site, as discussed above. Comment features allow for the discus- sion  of  points  of  confusion  without frequent meetings. To put this in perspective, the digital health industry leader, UpToDate, was  searched  4.1  million  times  for COVID-19 in that same time frame. In situations like the COVID-19 pandemic,  digital  collaboration  tools, such as CWAs and shared databases, can be used to expedite expert guidance and facilitate frequent re-review as new data emerge.  </p>

                                    If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks.
